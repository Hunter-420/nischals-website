            <p>
                As a developer, I often used REST APIs to build applications.
                While REST has its advantages, I faced some big challenges while
                working on different projects, including
                <a href="../../projects/chitchat/chitchat.html">
                    ChitChat, a real-time chat app</a
                >. Two common problems were
                <span class="heighlight"> over-fetching</span> and
                <span class="heighlight"> under-fetching</span>, which slowed me
                down. Additionally, managing many different endpoints in REST
                became a hassle. That’s when I discovered
                <span class="heighlight"
                    ><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/"> GraphQL</a></span
                >, which offered simple solutions to these issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Over-fetching: Getting Extra Data I Didn’t Need</h2>
            <p>
                With REST, sometimes I’d get way more data than I actually
                needed. Imagine I want only a user’s id and firstName to display
                in my app. In REST, a request like GET /users/123 might give me
                everything: id, firstName, lastName, email, password, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="heighlight">How GraphQL Fixes It:</span> With
                GraphQL, I can request only the exact data I need. If I just
                want id and firstName, I ask for only those:
            </p>
            <pre>
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
    </pre
            >
            <p>
                The server sends only what I asked for, which keeps things
                simple and fast.
            </p>

            <h2>Under-fetching: Not Getting Enough Data in One Request</h2>
            <p>
                The opposite problem is under-fetching, where I don’t get all
                the data I need in one go. With REST, if I need both a user’s
                details and their recent messages, I have to make multiple
                requests:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>GET /users/123 to get user details.</li>
                <li>GET /users/123/messages to get their messages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This back-and-forth means more requests and slows down the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="heighlight">How GraphQL Fixes It:</span> In
                GraphQL, I can ask for all the related data in a single query.
                If I need both the user info and recent messages, I just request
                both together:
            </p>
            <pre>
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    firstName
    messages {
      content
      timestamp
    }
  }
}
</pre
            >

            <h2>Single Endpoint for Everything</h2>
            <p>
                One of the standout features of GraphQL is its ability to
                operate through a single endpoint, ie. /graphql. In REST APIs, I
                had to create multiple endpoints for various actions. For
                instance, if I wanted to manage user data, I would need separate
                endpoints like /users for fetching the list of users, /users/123
                for getting details about a specific user, and
                /users/123/messages for retrieving a user’s messages. This
                fragmentation meant that as the project grew, so did the
                complexity of managing these numerous endpoints. It became
                increasingly challenging to keep track of which endpoint did
                what, especially when collaborating with others or scaling the
                application.
            </p>

            <p>
                With GraphQL, everything revolves around a single endpoint. This
                means that whether I want to fetch data, update information, or
                delete records, I can do it all through the same URL. The
                requests I send to this endpoint are structured in terms of
                queries and mutations.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                <span class="heighlight">Queries</span> are used to fetch data.
                They allow me to specify exactly what information I want from
                the server. For example, if I want to get a user’s id and
                firstName, I can write a query like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
</pre
            >

            <p>
                This request will return only the specified fields, making it
                efficient and tailored to my needs.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                <span class="heighlight">Mutations</span>, on the other hand,
                are used to modify data. For instance, when updating a user’s
                name, I can send a mutation request to the same /graphql
                endpoint without worrying about where that request needs to go:
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <pre>
mutation {
  updateUser(id: 123, firstName: "Raj") {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
</pre
            >

            <p>
                This simplicity significantly streamlines the development
                process. Instead of writing separate functions for each endpoint
                and method (like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE), I can focus on
                crafting queries and mutations that precisely specify what data
                I need or what changes I want to make.
            </p>

            <p>
                The server processes these queries and mutations through
                resolvers. <span class="heighlight">Resolvers</span> are
                functions that handle the logic for fetching or updating data
                based on the queries and mutations received. They act as a
                bridge between the client’s request and the database or any
                other data source. For instance, when a mutation to update a
                user’s name is sent, a corresponding resolver will handle the
                logic of updating the user’s information in the database and
                returning the updated data.
            </p>

            <p>
                Switching to GraphQL has made my projects easier to handle. It
                solves the over-fetching and under-fetching problems that slowed
                down my REST API and keeps my code cleaner. If you’re tired of
                dealing with these REST issues, I’d definitely recommend giving
                GraphQL a try. It’s not just a replacement; it actually makes
                working with APIs simpler and more efficient, especially if
                you’re building complex apps.
