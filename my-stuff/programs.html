        <img src="../img/archsystem.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
        <p>As a Developer, my setup is designed for efficiency and flexibility. Here’s a look at the programs and equipment that I rely on daily,You can check out my full <a href="https://github.com/Hunter-420/dotfiles" class="heighlight"> configuration files on GitHub </a>, which showcase my custom setups and preferences. </p>
        
        <h3>Operating System/Distribution: Arch Linux</h3>
        <p>I choose Arch Linux for its simplicity and customizability, allowing full control over my environment. <span class="heighlight"> Everything I need is available in the AUR </span>, making it easy to find and install the right packages.
</p>

        <h3> Terminal: Alacritty</h3>
        <p>Alacritty is fast and GPU-accelerated, enhancing my command-line experience. I can adjust the opacity to make it slightly transparent, which <span class="heighlight">look cool when using Neovim.</span></p>

        <h3> Shell: Bash</h3>
<p>I use Bash primarily because it comes as the default shell on many linux systems, and I haven’t found a compelling reason to switch to Zsh. It’s straightforward and reliable, making it a good fit for my current needs.</p>

<h3>Window Manager/Desktop Environment: i3</h3>
<p>i3's tiling capabilities help me manage windows efficiently and reduce distractions.</p>

<h3>Text Editing and Programming: Neovim</h3>

<p>I switched from VS Code to Neovim because VS Code is resource-heavy, and I don’t want to allocate my valuable resources to processes I rarely use. Neovim allows me to set up only the features that matter to me, enabling a lightweight and efficient coding environment optimized for my needs. I also have custom keybindings and powerful Vim plugins that significantly enhance my productivity and performance.</p>

<h3>Terminal Multiplexer: Tmux</h3>
<p>Tmux allows me to manage multiple terminal sessions easily, improving my multitasking efficiency.</p>

<h3>Web Browser: Chromium</h3>
<p> I use Chromium because it offers the ability to create <span class="heighlight">  multiple profiles </span>, which helps me separate and organize all my web pages effectively. Additionally, a recent update introduced a feature that <span class="heighlight">  pauses inactive tabs </span>, helping to <span class="heighlight"> save memory and improve performance </span>. I also use the<span class="heighlight">  uBlock Origin </span> extension for ad blocking and the React Development Tools extension for my development work, enhancing my overall browsing and development experience.</p>

<h3>File Manager: Ranger and Dolphin</h3>
<p>I use Ranger for terminal navigation and Dolphin for a user-friendly graphical interface.</p>

<h3>Music/Video Player: VLC </h3>
<p>VLC supports nearly every media format, making it my go-to player.</p>

<h3>Torrent Client: Transmission</h3>
<p>Transmission is lightweight and straightforward, making file downloads easy to manage.</p>

<h3>Document Writing: Google Docs and LibreOffice</h3>
<p>I use Google Docs for collaboration and LibreOffice for offline document creation.</p>
